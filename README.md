## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze unemployment rate data representing unemployed people percentage  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Explore unemployment trends over time  
- Study the impact of **Covid-19 (2020–2021)** on unemployment rates  
- Identify seasonal and regional patterns  
- Present insights useful for policymakers and economists

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** Unemployment in India  
- **Key Columns:**
  - `Date`
  - `Region`
  - `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)`
  - `Estimated Employed`
  - `Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)`
  - `Area` (Urban / Rural)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – statistical plots  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed leading/trailing spaces from column names  
- Converted `Date` column to datetime format  
- Handled invalid and missing values using coercion  
- Converted unemployment rate to numeric values  
- Sorted data by date for accurate trend analysis

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- National average unemployment trend over time  
- State-wise average unemployment comparison  
- Monthly unemployment trends (seasonality)  
- Rural vs Urban unemployment comparison  
- Rolling average analysis to smooth short-term fluctuations  

---

## 🦠 Impact of Covid-19
- A sharp spike in unemployment was observed during **early 2020**  
- Nationwide lockdowns caused severe job losses  
- Gradual recovery visible from late 2021 onward  
- Urban areas were more affected compared to rural areas  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Covid-19 caused the **highest unemployment surge** in recent years  
- Unemployment shows **seasonal patterns** across months  
- Recovery trends are uneven across regions  
- Policy intervention played a crucial role in stabilization  

---

## 🏛️ Policy Implications
- Need for emergency employment programs during crises  
- Strengthening social security systems  
- Skill development initiatives for vulnerable populations  
- Data-driven planning for future economic disruptions
